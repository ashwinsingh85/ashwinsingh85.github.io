With 6 years of industry practice, I’ve been creating seamless experiences through deep understanding of user
behaviours. I am currently working on cloud based enterprise solutions with a diverse and distributed team.
I’ve also been mentoring design interns and leading development teams in understanding importance of user 
research and experience.
